<h1>ANANT CHETNA DARSHAN</h1>
<h3>A Global Inquiry into Consciousness, Ethics & Universal Well-Being</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
Anant Chetna Darshan is a global, open and evolving inquiry.
Its purpose is to explore reality, consciousness and ethical wisdom
rooted in lived experience, cultural traditions and reflective understanding
for the welfare of human beings, living beings and the planet.
</p>

<p>
This is not a religion.
This is not an ideology.
This is not a claim of final truth.
</p>

<p>
It is an ongoing journey of listening, understanding and learning.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why This Initiative</h2>
<p>
Technology is advancing rapidly, but ethical wisdom often lags behind.
We believe knowledge is not produced only in laboratories,
and consciousness is not understood by logic alone.
</p>

<p>
This platform invites experience-based and tradition-rooted reflections,
not imagination or fictional narratives.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>First Global Call for Contributions</h2>
<p>
We invite scholars, thinkers, practitioners, elders and tradition-bearers
from all cultures to share reflections in their own languages.
</p>

<p>
Each contribution should relate to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Welfare of living beings</li>
<li>Ethical development of human beings</li>
<li>Global harmony and balance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Human–AI Ethics</h2>
<p>
AI is used only as an assisting tool for translation and pattern recognition.
Human ethical discernment remains central.
AI does not declare truth or conclusions.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Public Domain Declaration</h2>
<p>
This initiative, its framework and outputs are placed in the public domain
for open, non-commercial, ethical and collective inquiry.
No ownership. No monopoly. No final authority.

<h3>1. Equal Right to Life-Sustaining Resources</h3>
<p>
Every being born on this Earth has an equal right to basic life-sustaining resources
such as water, air, light, sky and natural resources beneath the Earth.
These are necessities for life, not privileges.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>2. Right to Live with the Condition of Coexistence</h3>
<p>
Every being has the right to live, provided it allows others to live.
When any individual, group or system obstructs the life of others,
conflict arises and outcomes become dependent on power rather than justice.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>3. Welfare of People as the Supreme Measure of Governance</h3>
<p>
Any system of governance—past or present, by whatever name—
is valid only so long as it serves the welfare of the people.
When governance ceases to be welfare-oriented, it becomes oppressive,
regardless of ideology or structure.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>4. Universal Right to Education and New Knowledge Systems</h3>
<p>
Education is a fundamental right.
All new educational methods and knowledge systems developed using public resources
must be accessible to all, so that societal development remains balanced and inclusive.
Ensuring that no one is deprived of education is a supreme duty of the state.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>5. Protection of Health as the Highest Public Service</h3>
<p>
There is no greater public service than the protection of health.
Safeguarding the physical, mental and environmental health of society
must remain the highest priority of any governing system.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>6. Ethics Integrated with Modern Education for Lasting Security</h3>
<p>
A healthy and educated society is generally secure.
However, without ethical development, mental distortions may arise.
Ethical growth must be integrated with modern education
so that societal security emerges from inner conscience,
not excessive policing or surveillance.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>7. Morality Arises from Within and Requires Continuous Practice</h3>
<p>
Morality does not originate from external enforcement.
It exists within every human being.
Circumstances may distort outward behavior, but inner morality remains.
Awakening this morality requires continuous practice,
not merely moral instruction.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>8. Integrated Ethics Rooted in Faith, Tradition and Values</h3>
<p>
Morality is embedded in faith, belief, tradition and cultural values.
Religious and cultural texts offer diverse expressions of ethical wisdom,
but morality is not confined to any single tradition.
Recognizing and integrating the shared ethical essence across traditions
is a human responsibility,
and nurturing this recognition is a continuous duty of governance.
