<h1>ANANT CHETNA DARSHAN</h1>
<h3>A Global Inquiry into Consciousness, Ethics & Universal Well-Being</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>
Anant Chetna Darshan is a global, open and evolving inquiry.
Its purpose is to explore reality, consciousness and ethical wisdom
rooted in lived experience, cultural traditions and reflective understanding
for the welfare of human beings, living beings and the planet.
</p>

<p>
This is not a religion.
This is not an ideology.
This is not a claim of final truth.
</p>

<p>
It is an ongoing journey of listening, understanding and learning.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Why This Initiative</h2>
<p>
Technology is advancing rapidly, but ethical wisdom often lags behind.
We believe knowledge is not produced only in laboratories,
and consciousness is not understood by logic alone.
</p>

<p>
This platform invites experience-based and tradition-rooted reflections,
not imagination or fictional narratives.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>First Global Call for Contributions</h2>
<p>
We invite scholars, thinkers, practitioners, elders and tradition-bearers
from all cultures to share reflections in their own languages.
</p>

<p>
Each contribution should relate to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Welfare of living beings</li>
<li>Ethical development of human beings</li>
<li>Global harmony and balance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Human–AI Ethics</h2>
<p>
AI is used only as an assisting tool for translation and pattern recognition.
Human ethical discernment remains central.
AI does not declare truth or conclusions.
</p>
